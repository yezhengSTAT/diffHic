\details{
The \code{plotPlaid} function constructs a plaid plot on the current graphics device.
The \code{anchor} and \code{target} regions are represented by the x- and y-axes, respectively.
Each region is partitioned into bins of size \code{width}.
Each bin pair is represented by a box in the plotting space, where each side of the box represents a bin.
The colour of the box depends on the number of read pairs mapped between the corresponding bins.

The resolution of colors can be controlled by varying \code{max.count}. 
All boxes with counts above \code{max.count} will be assigned the maximum intensity.
Other boxes will be assigned a color of intensity proportional to the size of the count, such that a count of zero results in white space.
Smaller values of \code{max.count} will improve contrast at low counts at the cost of contrast at higher counts. 
Scaling \code{max.count} is recommended for valid comparisons between libraries of different sizes (e.g., larger \code{max.count} for larger libraries).

If \code{count=TRUE}, the number of read pairs will be shown on top of each bin. 
This will be slower to plot but can be useful in some cases, e.g., when more detail is required, or when the range of colors is not sufficient to capture the range of counts in the data. 
If \code{diag=TRUE}, boxes will also be plotted above the diagonal for intra-chromosomal plots. 
This is set as the default to avoid confusion when anchor/target ordering is misspecified, but can be turned off to reduce redundancy in visualization around the diagonal.

The \code{rotPlaid} function constructs a plaid plot that has been rotated by 45 degrees.
This is useful for visualizing local interactions within a specified \code{region}.
In a rotated plot, the x-coordinate of a box in the plotting space represents the midpoint between two interacting bins, while the y-coordinate represents the distance between bins.
More simply, the interacting bins of a box can be identified by tracing diagonals from the edges of the box to the x-axis.

Note that the plotted boxes for the bin pairs may overwrite the bounding box of the plot.
This can be fixed by running \code{box()} after each \code{plotPlaid} call.
}

\value{
A (rotated) plaid plot is produced on the current graphics device. 
For both functions, a function is invisibly returned that converts counts into colors.
This is useful for coordinating the colors, e.g., when constructing a separate color bar.
