An R package for differential analyses of Hi-C data

This package provides methods for read pair processing and detection of differential interactions from Hi-C data. 
The repository here represents an unstable experimental version for masochists.
Regular users are advised to download the [devel](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/diffHic.html) (slightly more stable) or [release](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffHic.html) (very stable) versions from the Bioconductor project.
