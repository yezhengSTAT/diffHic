Description: Detects differential interactions across biological
        conditions in a Hi-C experiment. Methods are provided for read
        alignment and data pre-processing into interaction counts.
        Statistical analysis is based on edgeR and supports
        normalization and filtering. Several visualization options are
        also available.
