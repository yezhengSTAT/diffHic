Description: Detects differential interactions across biological conditions 
	in a Hi-C experiment. Methods are provided for read alignment and data 
	pre-processing into interaction counts. Statistical analysis is based 
	on edgeR and supports normalization and filtering. Several visualization 
	options are also available.
