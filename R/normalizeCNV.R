# marginal counts to compute the abundance and the marginal fold-changes,
# respectively. Both are used as covariates in the model to smooth out any
# systematic differences in interaction intensity. The aim is to get rid
# of any CNV-induced bias, quantified by the differences in the marginals.

##################### COMMENT ##########################
# You get two copy number changes for each bin pair, one for each region. The
# simplest coercion involves defining one covariate as the maximum change, and
# the other covariate as the minimum change. However, this gives a covariate
# space that is cut off past the diagonal. This won't be happily fitted in
# locfit, as it uses a rectangular grid (check out Computational Methods in
# Loader's book). You need all corners of the grid to interpolate, but one of
# those corners will be useless if it hangs on the wrong side of the diagonal.
# Instead, we rotate the space by 45 degrees, such that the diagonal is now a
# vertical line. The boundary of the grid now coincides with the true boundary
# of the space. All corners will now have sensible evaluations, such that 
# interpolation will be more reliable.
