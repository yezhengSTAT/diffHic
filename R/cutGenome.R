cutGenome <- function(bs, pattern, overhang=4L) 
# This finds the target cut sites in the genome. It currently only searches the
# sense strand, which is fine because if the patterns is an inverse palindrome.
# Otherwise, there may be some problems as you'd need to search the reverse
# strand as well.
